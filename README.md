# This project has been transferred to the following new repo: 
https://github.com/bryanteoh964/genji-neo4j-web-display-next
# Neo4j Database Requirements
Our DB is on Aura, and the Cypher commands embeded in the scripts will likely only fit our DB. If you are interested in using this project for your own DB, consider rewriting the cypher queries, and subsequently how are the data being treated throughout. If you also have a textual database, we will eventually post our node and relationship layout, as well as our schema. Until then, feel free to reach out.

# Neo4j-React Interaction
We display the following through the app: 
- Original Japanese poem (waka)
- Waka Romaji
- Waka translations in English
- Genji chapters in which the waka appear
- Characters who exchange waka
- Other poems which the waka alluded to

We organize these texts on the following pages:
- Poem page, where a user can query for a single waka and see it on the page with its romaji, its speaker(s) and addressee(s), its translations, etc.
- Poem search table, where a user can query for a list of waka by specifying constraints including chapter, speaker, addressee, etc. 
- Allusion table

# How to Use
1. Run `npm i` in the project root directory
2. Create a .env file at the project root directory. Details of the .env file can be found at [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv). 
3. Refer to the below Create React App description for what you could do next.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
